# Quiz-Console-Game
This project is a C++-based Quiz Game, developed as part of the Programming Fundamentals course. The main objective of this project is to apply basic PF concepts such as conditional statements, loops, functions, arrays, file handling, and simple logic-building.

The game allows users to test their knowledge through multiple categories such as Science, Logic, and Computer, each with three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. A set of questions is stored in text files, and the program randomly selects questions for the user during gameplay.

The project also includes a Leaderboard system that records player names and scores using file handling. Scores are sorted and displayed in ranking order, demonstrating practical use of arrays and sorting logic.

Additionally, the game features simple lifelines like 50/50, Skip Question,Swap Question and Extend Time—implemented using basic conditions and function calls, keeping the logic beginner-friendly and aligned with PF-level coding.

Overall, the project showcases how foundational programming concepts can be used to build a fully functional console-based application. It reflects understanding of C++ basics, modular program structure, file operations, and user interaction.
